A fat tree visualizer in Javascript.

New scenario controls (simple):
- GPU Rack %: fraction of edge racks modeled as GPU-heavy racks.
- GPU Demand x: per-rack traffic demand multiplier for GPU racks.
- GPU Uplink x: uplink capacity multiplier for GPU racks.
- Edge Oversub x: oversubscription factor applied to edge uplinks.

Visual cues:
- Green edge pods are GPU racks.
- Edge uplinks are colored by utilization (gray normal, amber warm, red congested).

Summary stats include GPU rack count, hot uplink count, max uplink utilization, and an ECMP path diversity estimate.
